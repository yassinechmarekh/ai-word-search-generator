## Supported AI Models

- `openai/gpt-4o-mini` (alternative option)
- Many other models available through OpenRouter

**Important Note on Word Generation:**
This application relies solely on the AI model to generate words. While the prompt asks for an exact number of words, AI models may sometimes return fewer words than requested, especially for very large quantities or niche themes. In such cases, the application will generate as many complete puzzles as possible with the words provided by the AI, and will inform you if fewer puzzles are generated than initially requested.

## Theme Suggestions

Try these popular themes:
- **Animals**: cat, dog, elephant, tiger, etc.
- **Sports**: soccer, basketball, tennis, etc.
- **Food**: pizza, burger, pasta, etc.
- **Science**: atom, molecule, gravity, etc.
- **Space**: star, planet, galaxy, etc.
- **Ocean**: whale, dolphin, coral, etc.
- **Nature**: tree, flower, mountain, etc.
- **Transportation**: car, plane, train, etc.
